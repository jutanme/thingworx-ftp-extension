# thingworx-ftp-extension
Contains the source code of the ThingWorx FTP Extension.
It does not contain the ThingWorx Extension SDK library files. Originally built with the ThingWorx Extension SDK version 6.5, but it should compile with the latest version.

This is an Ant Eclipse project. In order to import it, use the File Menu / Import / Projects from Folder or Archive. Alternatively, you can setup a new Ant based ThingWorx project, add the libraries from the lib folder, and use the source code PDFExport.java.

After that place the corresponding ThingWorx SDK files in the lib folder in the workspace folder.

Please open issues and feel free to fork it.
